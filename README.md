# Linear-Regression-Model

This repository contains some case studies on Machine Learning - Linear Regression Model.

I have worked with 4 individual datasets namely 
1.  Ground Cricket Chirps
2.  Brain vs Body weight
3.  Salary Discrimination 
4.  Car Price Prediction

and built a linear regression model for each respectively.
