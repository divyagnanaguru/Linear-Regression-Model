# Linear-Regression-Model

This repository contains some case studys on Machine Learning - Linear Regression Model.

I have worked with 3 individual datasets namely 
1.  Ground Cricket Chirps
2.  Brain vs Body weight
3.  Salary Discrimination 

and built a linear regression model for each respectively.
